These collections were made possible after the merger of Time Warner(which owned the color cartoons released from August 1, 1948, onward, as well as the black - and - white Looney Tunes, the post - Harman / Ising black - and - white Merrie Melodies and the first H / I Merrie Melodies entry Lady, Play Your Mandolin!) and Turner Broadcasting System(which owned the color cartoons released prior to August 1, 1948, and the remaining Harman/ Ising Merrie Melodies; most of these cartoons had been released as part of The Golden Age of Looney Tunes laserdisc series), along with the subsequent transfer of video rights to the Turner library from MGM Home Entertainment to Warner Home Video. The cartoons included on the set are uncut, unedited, uncensored and digitally restored and remastered from the original black - and - white and successive exposure Technicolor film negatives(or, in the case of the Cinecolor shorts, the Technicolor reprints). However, some of the cartoons in these collections are derived from the \"Blue Ribbon\" reissues(altered from their original versions with their revised front - and - end credit sequences), as the original titles for these cartoons are presumably lost.Where the original titles, instead of the \"Blue Ribbon\" titles, still exist, Warner has taken the \"Blue Ribbon\" titles out.";
